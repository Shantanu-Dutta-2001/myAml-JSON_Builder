## ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 Precision Blueprinting**: Define your JSON schema with a rich set of types: String, Number, Integer, Boolean, Object, Array, Date, Enum, and Null.
- **🧬 Deep Nesting**: Architect complex, recursive structures (e.g., Arrays of Objects containing deeply nested children) with zero friction.
- **⚡ Live Preview**: Instant JSON feedback as you iterate on your schema or data.
- **💎 Premium UI**: A curated "Violet Glass" design system built for focus and aesthetic pleasure.
- **⌨️ Developer Friendly**: Optimized focus management for seamless typing in complex nested forms.
